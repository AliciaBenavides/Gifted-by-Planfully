     <p>Planfully was started by two women looking to make a difference in the wedding space. We started with event planning, but when the pandemic hit, it was time to try something new. So welcome to Gifted by Planfully! The registry where gifting is made intentional. Our goal is to support black and brown (BIPOC) vendors and small businesses + brides simultaneously.<p>
